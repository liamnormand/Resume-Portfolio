# Resume-Portfolio
Portfolio of some of the CAD and Python work I've done, as well as personal projects.

Files are organized based on which project they are a part of. All of my code from my Python course is in one folder, and all of my SolidWorks projects are in another folder. Within the CAD folder, there are separate folders containing my contributions to the UMN Rocket Team CAD, my own L1 rocket model and OpenRocket, and my ongoing apartment modeling personal project broken down by SolidWorks, Blender, and a few renders of the UE5 environment for this project (Work In Progress!). The main reason why I taught myself the basics of SolidWorks and Blender is to work on this project, as I had the idea to model my apartment and needed to learn the tools to actually do it. Additionally, I've included some renders from a digital art project I undertook while first learning UE5 (I actually taught myself how to use Unreal Engine because I had the idea for this project!).
